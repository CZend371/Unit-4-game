# Unit-4-game
The game is called Crystal Collector. The object of the game is to click on a crystal and a value is output.  There are four crystals each with different values. The goal is to increase the users score until it reaches the a randomized target score which is shown in the window.
The user does not know the value of each crystal until they click on it. Once the score is either reached or passed, the game resets and either adds a win or a loss.
